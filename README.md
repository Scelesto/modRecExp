#ModRecExp
Recursive Python algorithm for modular exponentiation.

Optimizes the evaluation of statements of the form
![example](readme1.gif) by reducing using Euler's Theorem.

Designed for speeding up calculations in the case of large inputs.  It will not speed up calculations for inputs less than ~25.

Merely an algorithm. No installation required.
